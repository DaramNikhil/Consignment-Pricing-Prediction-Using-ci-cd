# Consignment Pricing Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts consignment pricing using machine learning techniques. It processes historical data to train a model that can predict future consignment prices. The entire workflow, from data processing to prediction, is handled within a single Python script, with automated testing and deployment set up using CI/CD practices.

## Features
- Predict consignment pricing based on historical data.
- Integrated CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Comprehensive data processing and model training.
